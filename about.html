			  <h2>About</h2>
				  <p>
					  Obstacle course racing has been a big part of my life beginning in 2013 
					  when I convinced a coworker to run the Spartan Beast with me. It was the
					  worst experience of my life, and during the race I swore I would 
					  absolutely never do one again! But by the car ride home I was planning
					  everything I could to make the next one better, I was officially hooked.
					  In our day to day lives we often do not complete anything that is extremely
					  taxing on our bodies and minds. I believe this leads us to an apathic 
					  lifestyle, one where nothing is ever really quite wrong or exactly right.
					  We don't have the confidence to be successful in our endeavors because
					  we have no idea of what we're actually capable of, and how far we can 
					  push ourselves to get there. Obstacle course racing provides this for us. 
					  We train our bodies in preparation to perform to the best of our capabilities,
					  and get a chance to realize how strong we really can be. I am a former 
					  Spartan SGX coach, an ISSA certified fitness trainer, and have completed
					  over 68 races in my career.
