							Wondering how your first race might go? Overthinking those obstacles?
							Worried about how many burpees you might have to complete? Carina 
							recently made a video to help guide you through some of the main obstacles
							encounter in racing.

							<h1>San Luis Obispo</h1>
							<time datetime="2022-03-12">03/12/22</time>
						</header>
						<p>
							This was our team's first time at the SLO venue. The first year it was scheduled
							to start it was cancelled due to COVID, so we were especially excited to 
							finally make it out. The venue, as you might imagine, is picturesque. Rolling
							hills and farmland create beautiful views throughout the race. </p>

						<p>
							That being said, this was a Beast, and we were far from our optimized 
							training...The first 6 miles went well, a beautiful sunny day, lots of 
							comraderie, and fun obstacles. However as the race continued we started 
							to drag down. The rolling hills became steeper and more intense, as the time
							in between obstacles decreased. It didn't take long before our forearms were 
							so full of lactic acid that we could barely grip anything, making for an 
							especially difficult ropeclimb. A lot of burpees were performed, but we managed
							to finish in good spirits.

							<h1>Oracle Park</h1>
							<time datetime="2021-12-04">12/04/21</time>
						</header>
						<p>
							First off, this race is a Stadion. If you've never raced a Stadion before let 
							us inform you of some great news: obstacle failure leads to 15 penalty 
							burpees, not 30. That's right, 15! Half the burpees right off the bat! As
							if that weren't exciting enough, you're also getting a chance to race in 
							a stadium that professional athletes compete in. There's not quite 
							anything like running across the baseball field you see weekly on TV. It
							feels absolutely surreal. </p> 

						<p>
							Stadion races are short and sweet, often coming in at only 2.5 miles. This
							leaves you with the time and energy to run multiple laps, if desired. 
							There is also much more opportunity to mingle after a race, and you can
							sit in the stands to watch others continue racing. This also makes this
							the perfect venue to bring spectators to. In traditional races there 
							are not many view points for spectators, and they have to travel across
							multiple points of the course just to see you complete an obstacle. With
							the Stadion race almost all obstacles are in full view, or easily accessed,
							allowing your spectators to watch you the entire way through.

							<h1>Monterey</h1>
							<time datetime="2021-08-21">08/21/21</time>
							</header>

						<p>
							Monterey has always been a favorite venue, we have been racing it since 
							2014, when it was a Beast. In the years since then they have, thankfully,
							reduced it too a much more manageable Sprint and Super weekend. The race
							always takes place in June, allowing for great weather. The mornings are
							cool and misty, and the sun warms up the air as the day progesses. Since
							the venue is nearer to the coast, there is almost always a cool breeze.
							Don't let this trick you into not weearing suncreen, much of the course
							is exposed hills, so you will have to wear suncreen. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This course uses a lot of the parks hiking trails. This means there is
							a lot of single track portions of the race, and plenty of poision oak.
							Long pants are recommended, unless you would like to spend a few weeks
							after the race treating poison oak you never even noticed on the trail.
