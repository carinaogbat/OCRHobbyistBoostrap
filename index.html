  			<h2>Welcome to OCR Hobbyist</h2>
			<h3>Where we discuss everything OCR!</h3>
			<p>
				The OCR Hobbyist is here to share all the latest tips, tricks, and 
				updates for each Spartan Race attended by our team. Through our blog
				you will learn all about the venues, race-day how tos, and tips for
				obstacle completion. We also share the most recent race stats of our
				teammembers, to help give you an idea of an average to competitive 
				completion time. We also offer the opportunity to run an open race
				with a teammember for beginners, or those who just don't want to race
				alone. To run in the next open race with a team member please be sure
				to <a href="about.html#contact">contact</a> us. The distances run by
				the team are mainly Sprints (5 K) and Supers (10 K), though we 
				participate in Beasts (21 K) as well. Most of the races attended 
				are West Coast based, though we hope to expand to East Coast as well
				as worldwide soon!

				<h3>What is OCR anyway?</h3>
				<p>
					OCR, also known as obstacle course racing, is a sport in which each 
					participant racing on foot in an event must complete obstacles in 
					order to finish the race. Obstacles may include things such as: barbed
					wire crawls, rope climbs, wall climbs, monkey bar and ninja warrior
					like traversals, and carrying heavy objects.
